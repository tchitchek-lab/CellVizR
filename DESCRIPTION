Title: Visualization and statistical analysis of high dimensional cytometry data using manifold representations
Description: Cytometry data are now classically analyzed using non linear dimensionality reduction approaches, but it is still challenging to easily handle the whole pipeline of computational analyses. 
	UMAPVizR allows the statistical analysis and visualization of high dimensional cytometry data using manifold algorithms and clustering methods.  Especially, several key analysis steps are available to perform data importation, manifold generation, cell cluster identification, statistical analyses, cluster visualization, and quality controls of generated results. 
	UMAPVizR can import cell events from FCS or txt file formats using different transformation, down-sampling, and normalization approaches. 
	Manifold representations can be generated using the UMAP, tSNE or LargeVis algorithms to project cell events into a lower dimensionality space. The identification of cell clusters can be done using multiple clustering algorithms, depending on userâ€™s assumptions. 
	The characteristics of cell clusters can be visualized using scatter plot, categorical heatmap of marker expressions, or using parallel coordinates representations. Cell clusters having abundances differently expressed between biological conditions can be identified using several statistical tests. 
	Statistical results can be visualized using volcano plots or heatmaps. 
	Unsupervised and supersized analysis approaches can be conducted by users to appreciate the homogeneity/heterogeneity of biological conditions, and to identify cell population biomarkers in a multivariate manner. 
	Additionally, UMAPVizR provides a workflow for asserting the quality of identified cell clusters using statistical approaches.
