Title: Visualization and statistical analyses of single-cell data using manifold representations
Description: The profiling of biological samples at the single-cell level, using either high-dimensional cytometry or single-cell transcriptomics, is becoming more and more common. Such generated data are usually analyzed using manifold algorithms, such as UMAP, tSNE, or LargeVis, combined with cell clustering algorithms. Nevertheless, this is still challenging for non-bioinformatician experts to easily handle the whole pipeline of computational analyses with the purpose of answering specific biological questions. CellVizR is an R package that allows the visualization and statistical analyses of single-cell data using manifold algorithms and clustering methods. Especially, several key analysis steps are available to perform (i) data importation; (ii) manifold generation and visualization; (iii) cell cluster identification; (iv) characterization of cell clusters; (v) statistical analysis of cell cluster abundances; (vi) multivariate analysis using both unsupervised and supervised algorithms; (vii) quality controls of input files and generated results. CellVizR can import cell events from FCS, MTX or txt file formats using different transformation and down-sampling approaches.  Manifold representations can be generated using the UMAP, tSNE or LargeVis algorithms to project cell events into a two-dimensionality space. The identification of cell clusters can be done using multiple clustering algorithms, depending on userâ€™s assumptions.  The characteristics of cell clusters can be visualized using scatter plots, categorical heatmaps of marker expressions, or using parallel coordinate representations. Cell clusters having abundances different between biological conditions can be identified using several statistical tests.  Statistical results can be visualized using volcano plots or heatmaps. Unsupervised and supersized analysis approaches can be conducted by users to appreciate the homogeneity/heterogeneity of biological conditions, and to identify cell population biomarkers in a multivariate manner.  Additionally, CellVizR provides a workflow for asserting the quality of identified cell clusters using statistical approaches.
